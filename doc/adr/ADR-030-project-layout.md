# ADR-030: Project Layout — Build Tool and Namespace Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
ADR-001 fixes Clojure on the JVM (and names the core libraries — `next.jdbc`, `Malli`, `honey.sql`, `core.async`) but says nothing about the build tool or how the codebase is organised into namespaces. The architecture has a two-layer separation (ADR-004: data vs meta) and a determinism boundary (ADR-014: the LLM never executes; everything inside the boundary is pure). How those seams are *expressed in the code* — which build tool, which namespace roots, how the seam is enforced — is undecided. ADR-026's illustrative domain calls used a `solar.*` namespace root that was never actually chosen.

This ADR owns the project layout decision. The per-subsystem namespace lists and the directory tree are TDD-level detail (TDD-00 states the rules; TDDs 01–07 name their own namespaces); this ADR fixes the build tool, the roots, and the enforcement mechanism.

## Options Considered

### Build tool
- **Leiningen** — batteries-included (`lein repl`, `lein uberjar`, profiles); `project.clj` is eval'd code, more convention and magic.
- **deps.edn + tools.build** (Clojure CLI) — declarative, minimal; dev/test/nrepl assembled via aliases; packaging via `tools.build`.
- **Polylith** (on deps.edn) — enforces a brick/component architecture with explicit interfaces; the subsystem seams (01–07) map ~1:1 to bricks, so the build would enforce the seam discipline.

### Namespace roots
- **Single-root flat** — `ilanga.readings`, `ilanga.days`, `ilanga.engine`, … all at one level; seam by naming convention only.
- **Nested** — `ilanga.domain.*` (data layer) + `ilanga.*` top-level (meta + adapters); the data layer is a visible subtree.
- **Dual-root** — `solar.*` (a generic domain) + `ilanga.*` (the product); honors the `solar.*` names used illustratively in ADR-026.

## Decision
**deps.edn + `tools.build`**, single project. Entry point `ilanga.main/-main` via a `:run` alias.

**Nested namespace roots**, both under the project name, mapping to ADR-004's two layers:
- **`ilanga.domain.*` — the data layer.** Facts, entity schemas, pure KPI/Period computation, the Malli entity registry, and the persistence *ports* (query-vocabulary protocols such as `Readings`, plus the `TenantStore` record that carries their impls). Pure: depends only on libraries and other `ilanga.domain.*` namespaces — and **never** on a storage engine: no `next.jdbc`, no SQL, no table/column-type name, no file path. The query *intent* lives here; its realization lives in the adapter (ADR-035).
- **`ilanga.*` (top-level, non-`domain`) — the meta layer + adapters.** Ingestion and protocol decoding, engine orchestration, the LLM surface, registry/config, billing orchestration, runtime, the persistence *adapter* (`ilanga.db`, which owns `open-store` and the SQL realization of the domain's ports), and `main`. May depend on `ilanga.domain.*`.

**The seam is enforced by a namespace-dependency lint rule**, not convention: `ilanga.domain.*` may never require an infra namespace (and specifically may not require `next.jdbc` or any SQL/JDBC library, nor name a storage engine — ADR-035); infra may require domain. This is what prevents the data layer drifting into the meta layer and the domain coupling to an engine. The seam is also the determinism boundary (ADR-014): everything pure and inside the boundary is `ilanga.domain.*`; the boundary and everything outside is `ilanga.*`.

**Directory == namespace.** Namespace segments map to path segments, so the rules above are the layout; no separate tree is specified.

**Entity schemas are co-located** with their repository functions (`ilanga.domain.readings` defines `::reading` next to its query/write fns); only *references* are aggregated into the Malli entity registry in `ilanga.domain.schema`, used by the ADR-019 scope validator and for cross-entity `[:ref]` resolution. The registry is an explicit value threaded via `:registry`, not global state. (ADR-019 already assumes "the entity schema registry"; this ADR fixes where its definitions live and how it is assembled.)

**Hardware descriptors are data, not code** — edn under `resources/hardware/{hardware-id}.edn`, loaded at boot, outside the LLM `:register` scope. There is deliberately no `ilanga.protocol.<model>` namespace; the only protocol code is the generic descriptor-driven decoder (`ilanga.protocol.decode`) plus the algorithm registry it dispatches into. This instantiates ADR-018's "new model = new descriptor, not new code."

## Rationale
- **deps.edn** matches the determinism/auditability ethos and ADR-001's REPL-driven note; declarative `deps.edn` is data, not eval'd code. `tools.build` covers packaging without Leiningen's convention overhead.
- **Nested** makes ADR-004's two layers and ADR-014's determinism boundary *visible* in the namespace tree and recoverable as a directory (`src/ilanga/domain/`), while `:as` aliasing neutralizes the call-site cost — `(readings/latest …)` is identical whether the require reads `ilanga.readings` or `ilanga.domain.readings`. The only real cost is longer require lines, which is minor.
- **Dependency-direction lint** enforces the seam structurally rather than relying on review; the alternative (convention only) is how data/meta drift begins.
- **Co-located schemas** avoid the indirection of a central schema bucket (the entity dependency graph is a DAG — Cycle→Day+Overnight, Reconciliation→BillingCycle, nothing back — so co-location creates no cycles), while the registry gives the validator and cross-entity refs one resolution point.
- **Single product root (`ilanga`) over dual-root (`solar`)** — the domain is product-named rather than kept generic; avoids the thematic redundancy of two "sun" names and avoids a generic-word classpath collision. The benefit of dual-root (a reusable, product-agnostic domain core) is not a near-term goal and does not require a separate root to preserve — the `ilanga.domain.*` subtree remains a clean extraction candidate if that ever matters.
- **Descriptor-as-data** makes "new model = new descriptor, not new code" literally true: adding a model is a data file, zero code.

## Consequences
- (+) The data/meta seam and the determinism boundary are visible in the tree and enforced by lint — the compiler/linter catches a domain namespace drifting into infra.
- (+) The domain is a coherent subtree, testable and (if ever needed) extractable as a unit; infra is flat at the top where it is rarely called from outside.
- (+) Short high-frequency call sites via aliasing; adding a model is a data file.
- (+) Schema changes live next to the code that uses and enforces them.
- (-) A namespace-dependency lint config to maintain; the one genuinely fuzzy classification (engine *orchestration* = `ilanga.engine` vs *pure KPI math* = `ilanga.domain.kpis`) requires discipline — the same discipline ADR-007/010 already demand.
- (-) Two roots to classify; a new namespace must be placed domain-vs-infra (usually obvious).
- (-) A deployable uberjar is platform-specific — DuckDB and SQLite ship native libraries inside their jars (build on the target OS; acceptable for a single-home deployment).
- (-/planned) `ilanga.db` holds the SQL realization for every entity's port (ADR-035). It is one namespace while only `Readings` exists; it splits per-entity into `ilanga.db.readings`, `ilanga.db.config`, `ilanga.db.days`, … when a second entity's SQL lands. `open-store` remains the single assembly point. This is a deliberate growth event, not a drift.

## Alternatives Considered
- **Leiningen** — rejected: more magic, `project.clj` is eval'd code rather than data, heavier; the packaging convenience does not outweigh the determinism/declarative ethos.
- **Polylith** — rejected for now: a tool and mental model for a one-operator, one-app system; the seam is enforced adequately by a lint rule. Revisit if we ever want build-enforced brick boundaries and a multi-base workspace.
- **Single-root flat `ilanga.*`** — rejected: the data/meta seam would be conventional only, with no visible subtree and no structural grouping; relies entirely on the lint rule and naming, with no navigational signal.
- **Dual-root `solar.*` + `ilanga.*`** — rejected: thematically redundant (both mean "sun"), exposes a generic-word classpath collision, and a product-named domain (`ilanga.domain.*`) preserves the extraction option without a second root.
